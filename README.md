## song creation

* assume that You are a PIANIST, and you want to mix and match frequencies to generate your own song.
* Generate your own signal using 洧녜 pairs of notes chosen from the 3rd and4th piano octaves assuming that you are playing will both hands at the same time (3rd octave with the left hand/ 4th octave with right hand)
* **Each piano key/note frequency is given below,**

* **Your final song could be generated as follows,**

* the total song playing time is setted to 3 seconds starting from 0 for 12 x 1024 samples.

*  you can freely Customize your own song by setting the number of pairs of notes 洧녜. For each pair number 洧녰, set the left hand frequency 픺洧녰, right hand frequency 洧녭洧녰, the pressing starting time 洧노洧녰, and how long you will press both keys 洧녢洧녰.

* If you want to play with one hand only, you can set the frequency of the other hand to 0.

## noise cancellation

_Goal: Noise Cancelation by using frequency domain conversion_

* Assume that additional noise is generated by a child who kept pressing the same 2 random piano keys during your song playing interval such that the noise is represented as follows,

* Where, 洧녭洧녵1 and 洧녭洧녵2 are two frequencies selected randomly from the 3rd and 4th octaves frequencies list respectively.

*  Note that each time you run the code you will get different noise generated and added to the song.

* we add the generated noise signal to the song and try to cancel it :

    1. Convert the time signal 洧논(洧노) of the song to the frequency signal 洧녦(洧녭) form.
    2. Add the generated noise 洧녵(洧노) to the signal 洧논(洧노) 
    3. Convert the noise contaminated signal 洧논洧녵(洧노) to the signal 洧녦洧녵(洧녭) in frequency domain
    4. Find the two random noise frequencies: by finding the frequency indices that corresponds to the peaks of the signal 洧녦洧녵 洧녭 which is higher than the maximum peak of the original signal 洧녦(洧녭) without noise rounded to the next integer
    5.  Round the frequency values at that indices in 洧녭 to get 洧녭洧녵1 and 洧녭洧녵2 (since we generate random integer values of frequencies) 
    6. Filter the noise by subtracting two tones with the two found frequencies
    7. Play the filtered signal to make sure that you get the same original sound without noise
